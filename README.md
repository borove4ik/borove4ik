<h3 align="left">👩‍💻  About Me</h3>

###

<p align="left">🐧I am passionate about frontend development. Beautifully and functionally designed websites/applications have always excited me. Even before I started learning about web development, I would often notice when sites weren’t as well-designed or functional from a user experience standpoint and think about how they could be improved.</p>

<p align="left">⚖️ For several years, I worked as a lawyer. However, over time I realized that law was more of a tool for me (a set of instruments that simplify life in many ways) rather than something I wanted to dedicate my entire life to. I felt a lack of creativity and flexibility in the profession. That’s when I started thinking about what truly interests me and what I would like to pursue. </p>

<p align="left">👀 While transitioning careers, I realized I had my own vision of how websites could look beautiful and what functionality could be added or removed. Initially, I thought my choice might be UX/UI design. However, after exploring different IT professions in more detail, I found that coding gave me more satisfaction, and I decided to focus on development.</p>

<p align="left">👨‍🎓 I started by learning the basics on my own, but soon realized I needed a more structured approach and feedback on my code. That’s why I decided to enroll in the Web Development course at Yandex.Practicum, where I received a diploma in professional retraining. However, I don’t plan to stop there and continue to improve my skills.</p>

<p align="left">📷 In my free time, I enjoy photography and motorsports, especially Formula 1.</p>

<p align="left">🌎I was born and raised in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and currently live in Kazakhstan. I’m open to exploring the world and relocating to other countries. I love traveling and have visited 29 countries, but I know there’s still so much more to see.</p>
